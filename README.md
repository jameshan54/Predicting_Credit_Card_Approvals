# Predicting_Credit_Card_Approvals

Built an automatic credit card approval predictor using **machine learning techniques**.  
Applied several **classification models** such as <code>Decision Tree</code>, <code>K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)</code>, <code>Gradient Boost</code>, <code>Random Forest</code>, <code>XGBoost</code>, and <code>Logistic Regression</code>.  
Were able to improve the model's ability to predict credit card approvals by performing a **grid search**.

This is the extension of the projects from Data Camp: https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/558  
Also, the dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval
